Medium

Given an integer n, return the number of structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) which has exactly n nodes of unique values from 1 to n.

Example 1:

```s
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
```

Example 2:

```s
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 19

hint: ( Catalan number factorial equation: 2n!/(n+1)!n!)
