# [242. Valid Anagram](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150)

Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:

```s
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```s
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 \* 104
- s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?
