# [230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/?envType=featured-list&envId=top-100-liked-questions?envType=featured-list&envId=top-100-liked-questions)

Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) of all the values of the nodes in the tree.

Example 1:

```s
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```s
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is n.
- 1 <= k <= n <= 104
- 0 <= Node.val <= 104

Follow up: If the BST is modified often (i.e., we can do insert and delete operations) and you need to find the kth smallest frequently, how would you optimize?
