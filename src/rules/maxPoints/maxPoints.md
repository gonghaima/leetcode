# [149. Max Points on a Line](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-points-on-a-line/)

Hard

Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, return the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

Example 1:

```s
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 3
```

Example 2:

```s
Input: points = [[1,1],[3,2],[5,3],[4,1],[2,3],[1,4]]
Output: 4
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= points.length <= 300
- points[i].length == 2
- -104 <= xi, yi <= 104
- All the points are unique.
