# [131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/)

Medium

Given a string s, partition s such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of s.

A palindrome string is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

```s
Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]
```

Example 2:

```s
Input: s = "a"
Output: [["a"]]
```

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 16
- s contains only lowercase English letters.
