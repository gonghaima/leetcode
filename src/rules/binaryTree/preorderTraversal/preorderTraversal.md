Pre-order Traversal
Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree.

Here is an example:

Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:

Input: [1,null,2,3]
<pre>
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
</pre>
Output: [1,2,3]
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
